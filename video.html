  Universal Parks and Resorts (also known as Universal Studios Theme Parks) is the theme park division of NBCUniversal,approximately 30.8 million guests visited the Universal Studios theme parks, making it the third-largest amusement park operator in the world.
  </h3>
  <p>Universal Studios Florida is a theme park located in Orlando, Florida. Opened on June 7, 1990, the park's theme is the entertainment industry, in particular movies and television. Universal Studios Florida inspires its guests to "ride the movies", and it features numerous attractions and live shows. The park is one component of the larger Universal Orlando Resort.
  </p><br/>
  <p>Many of the park's past and present attractions were developed with the actual creators of the films they were based on, and feature the original stars as part of the experience. Steven Spielberg helped create E.T. Adventure and was a creative consultant for Back to the Future: The Ride, Twister...Ride it Out, An American Tail Theatre, Jaws, Men in Black: Alien Attack and Transformers: The Ride.
  </p><br/>
  <p>A major component of the original park in Hollywood is its studio tour, which featured several special-effects exhibits and encounters built into the tour, such as an attack by the great white shark from the film Jaws. For its Florida park, Universal Studios took the concepts of the Hollywood tour scenes and developed them into larger, stand-alone attractions. 
  </p><br/>
  <p> Each area features a combination of rides, shows, attractions, character appearances, dining outlets and merchandise stores. A further two areas,one based on The Simpsons opened in 2013 and one based on Harry Potter will be added to the park in 2014.
